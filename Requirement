A math teacher needs a program that will help students test different properties of complex numbers,
provided in the a+bi form (assume a, b integers for simplicity). The program manages a list of
complex numbers and allows its user to repeatedly execute the following functionalities (each
functionality is exemplified):
  1. Add numbers to the list.
add <number>
insert <number> at <position>
e.g.
add 4+2i – adds 4+2i at the end of the list
insert 1+1i at 1 – insert number 1+i at position 1 in the list; positions are numbered from 0.
  2. Modify elements from the list.
remove <position>
remove <start position> to <end position>
replace <old number> with <new number>
e.g.
remove 1 – removes the number at position 1.
remove 1 to 3 – removes the numbers at positions 1,2, and 3.
replace 1+3i with 5-3i – replaces all the occurrences of number 1+3i with the number 5-3i.
  3. Write numbers having different properties.
list
list real <start position> to <end position>
list modulo [ < | = | > ] <number>
e.g.
list – write the list of numbers.
list real 1 to 5 – writes the real numbers (imaginary part =0) between positions 1 and 5 in the
list.
list modulo < 10 – writes all numbers having modulo <10 from the list.
list modulo = 5 – writes all numbers having modulo =10 from the list.
  4. Obtain different characteristics of sub-lists.
sum <start position> to <end position>
product <start position> to <end position>
e.g.
sum 1 to 5 – writes the sum of the numbers between positions 1 and 5 in the list.
product 1 to 5 - writes the product of numbers between position 1 and 5 in the list.
  5. Filter the list.
filter real
filter modulo [ < | = | > ] <number>
e.g.
filter real – keep only real numbers (imaginary part =0) in the list.
filter modulo < 10 – keep only those numbers having modulo <10 in the list.
filter modulo > 6 – keep only those numbers having modulo >6 in the list.
  6. Undo the last operation that modified program data.
undo – the last operation that has modified program data will be reversed. The user has to be
able to undo all operations performed since program start by repeatedly calling this function.
